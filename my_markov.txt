The end of the


Hate to be a sweet boy
And I'm not looking for just
Anyone I'm slipping below the water
Line I'm slipping below the water
Line the end of
The love he couldn't
Get over your frankly vulgar red pullover
Now see how the two
Colours blend won't somebody stop me from
Pity sympathy and people
Discussing me a barrel and watch me
Scrape it faced with
The joy you find
Leave me alone I was
Easy meat but a reasonably
Good buy a daily newspaper
And you slid
Right through my
Fingers no not literally but metaphorically and now
You're all I can stay oh
Or if you can do
Well I was
Happy to stay and the spray
You will ever know
You'll never see all my old
Friends let me
See all the fun
In life are
Behind glass money jewelry and flesh and what's
Left for me fatty
You're the one for
Me fatty you're the one I really
Really love and I love

Found driving


Breaths and you start to imagine
Things oh any excuse to write
More lies he's just too good looking
He's just too good looking he's
Just too good looking
He's just too good
Natured and he's got too
Much and look
Around can you squeeze
Me into an empty page of
Your dreams is here all alone oh
There is something that you physically despise
But my heart is full
Now my heart that's just the way
They did when we go we all
Will go so I turn the music
Down and will salute him and will
Time ever pass will time ever pass
Will time ever pass will time never
Pass for us your weary
Wife is walking
Away your nephew it's true well he thinks
He owns this city he overspeeds
And he lovers and would
You ouija board would
You say that the more you chase
The more you ignore
Me the closer I get you're

The end satan


Your name I could
Have dragged you in guilt by
Implication by association i've always been
True to you there's
Too many people planning your
Downfall when your spirit's on trial these
Nights can be frightening sleep transports
Sadness to some other mid brain
And somebody here will not be here
Next year so you stand by the board
Full of fear
And intention and if
You were on a groundsheet
Under canvas with your tent flap open
Wide a note upon his
Desk ps bring
Me home and have
Me leather elbows on a tweed
Coat oh is that
The best you can do so
Came his reply but on the desk
Is where I want
You so I ask even though I know
Were you and he lovers
And if you think
That you should everyone's
Laughing since I took
Up with you I took
My job application into town
Did you hear they
Turned me down yes and it's
All because of us and what was

Sleeping girl drowning used to


Hand and caress
With your left
Hand everyone I know is sick to the tattoo
Of you ever since you don't
Look the same you're
Just not the same
No way you say
Clever things and you never
Used to you don't
Catch what I'm saying when you're deafened
To advice everyone here
Is sick to the back
Teeth of you with a tear
That's a mile wide in
The kite that you're flying everyone I know
Is sick to the tattoo of you ever
Since you don't look the same
You're just not the same
No way you say clever things
And you never used
To you don't catch what I'm saying
When you're deafened to advice ever
Since you don't
Look the same you're just not the same
No way you say pleasant
Things and there
Is no need to be
So avoiding ordinary boys happy
